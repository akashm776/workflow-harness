## Design Hardening Documentation

- `SECURITY_ASSUMPTIONS_AND_LIMITS.md` records the current security boundary and
  the deferred enforcement gaps.
- `AUTHORITY_SUBSUMPTION_DESIGN.md` is a design-only checkpoint: it defines the
  future partial-order model that would be required before approval carryover or
  narrowed-authority reuse. Authority subsumption is design-only and is not
  implemented; exact-match approval remains the current behavior.
- `REAL_EXECUTION_THREAT_MODEL.md` is a design-only checkpoint and is not
  implemented; V1 remains no-op only. Real execution remains blocked behind
  sandbox/broker isolation, connector/tool allowlists, a side-effect policy,
  post-retrieval re-gating, deterministic audit, and fail-closed requirements.
- `CANONICAL_JSON_V1.md` documents the currently implemented canonical JSON
  contract.
- canonical JSON characterization tests pin the current serializer and hashing
  behavior (`tests/test_canonical_json.py`).
- authority schema hardening rejects floats and non-finite values in
  authority-bearing artifacts:
  - `compiler/authority_value_validator.py` is the validation gate.
  - violations fail compile with `DISALLOWED_AUTHORITY_VALUE` diagnostics.
  - applied to loaded input artifacts and compiler-emitted authority artifacts.
  - `canonical_json.py` and hashing behavior are unchanged.
- static schema validation rejects malformed proposal shapes:
  - WorkflowSpec static schema validation checks required top-level fields and
    node/edge primitive types.
  - NodeTypeRegistry static schema validation checks required fields and
    node-type entry shape (`node_type`, `max_outgoing_edges`, `required_scopes`,
    `side_effect_class`).
  - RequestedAuth static schema validation checks required fields and
    connector/tool entry shape (`requested_connectors`, `connector_name`,
    `scope`, `requested_tools`, `tool_name`).
  - ApprovalRequests static schema validation checks required fields and request
    entry shape (`requests`, `request_id`, `node_id`, `approval_subject_hash`).
  - ApprovalDecisions static schema validation checks required fields and
    decision entry shape (`decisions`, `request_id`, `decision`); it runs only
    when `ApprovalDecisions.json` is present/provided.
  - `INVALID_ARTIFACT_SCHEMA` diagnostics (artifact + JSON path) apply to all five
    control-plane inputs:
    - `WorkflowSpec.json`
    - `NodeTypeRegistry.json`
    - `RequestedAuth.json`
    - `ApprovalRequests.json`
    - `ApprovalDecisions.json`
  - static schema hardening across control-plane inputs is complete.
  - validation is phased, and each phase gates the next even in aggregate mode:
    1. authority-value validation
    2. schema validation (Phase 2 now validates all five control-plane input
       shapes)
    3. interpretation validation (graph, scope, approval semantics)
- planner skeleton produces non-authoritative candidate proposals only:
  - `planner/workflow_spec_planner.py` builds a deterministic stub candidate
    (`WorkflowSpec.json`, `RequestedAuth.json`, `ApprovalRequests.json`) from a
    plain-text goal; the goal is carried as non-authoritative metadata only.
  - planner output is non-authoritative until compiler validation; the compiler
    remains the sole authority boundary.
  - no LLM call, no real authority inference, no execution, no compiled or
    runtime artifacts are written by the planner.
  - `cli/planner_check_cli.py` turns a `--goal` into a candidate and runs the
    compiler validate/compile check against a provided `NodeTypeRegistry.json`,
    writing only candidate input files (no compiled, audit, or runtime
    artifacts); exits 0 on compile ok, 1 on failure.
  - `planner_check_cli --dry-run` runs the same check via a temporary candidate
    bundle, leaving nothing on disk (no candidate-dir, no artifacts) and never
    exposing the temporary path; output adds `"dry_run": true`.
  - documented in `PLANNER_SKELETON.md`.

## Explicit Non-Goals

- no real execution
- no tools or connectors
- no authority subsumption
- no approval carryover
- no full TUI framework (a dependency-free status view and loop already exist)
- no LLM-backed planner and no authoritative planner output (the deterministic
  planner skeleton exists, but its output stays non-authoritative until compiler
  validation)
- no real policy evaluation

## Recommended Next Milestone Options

Design- and inspection-first, consistent with the current no-op boundary. Real
execution and real tools remain out of scope until their design checkpoints are
complete and reviewed.

1. Authority subsumption: refine per-dimension narrowing rules (design only,
   building on `AUTHORITY_SUBSUMPTION_DESIGN.md`; no reuse/carryover behavior).
2. Sandbox/broker execution interface: design the broker contract and
   verification requirements (design only, building on
   `REAL_EXECUTION_THREAT_MODEL.md`; no sandbox implementation).
3. Connector/tool allowlist and side-effect classification: design the governed
   catalog schema (declared, scoped, versioned, compiler-approved) without
   implementing any tool or connector.
4. Audit characterization: pin deterministic audit-event shape for proposed and
   denied side effects (inspection/tests only).
